sample.input: This test defines a class with a variable L that is passed in
through the constructor. It also has 3 functions which ar cons car and cdr
(spelled backwards) that are performed on the variable L. The test is to 
instanciate a test object with [] and then cons 3 2 and 1 to it then set
a variable equal to the car and cdr of the object. The result should be the
list being [1,2,3], listcar being 1, listcdr being [2,3]

sample.input2: Same as above excpet two lists are made and the second one
performs cons on 4 5 and 6. The calls are intermingled and then they the
car and cdr of each are set to variables. The result should be ListA=[1,2,3]
listACar=1, listACdr=[2,3], ListB=[6,5,4], ListBCar=6, ListBCdr=[5,4] 

sample.input3: A class called superobject is created that is a copy of the
class created above. Then two subclasses are made called subobjectA and
subobjectB. both of them have a local variable named local that is set to
the variable passed through the constructor. Then both are instantiated
subA is a subobjectA with the variable [3] passed. subB is a subobjectB with
the variable [5] passed. Then some variables are set to the local and super
variables of both so they can be viewed. The subALocal should be [3]. The
subBLocal should be [5]. The subAsuper should be [3]. The subBsuper should
be [5]. This is because local is the variable passed and then it is passed
to the super constructor which sets super to the same value. The main
purpose of this is to demonstrate that both can have different
instantiations of the super class with independent values.
