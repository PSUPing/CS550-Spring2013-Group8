the syntax is as follows:

class <ident>(<paramList>)[:<ident>]
<stmtList>
end

where brackets indicate optional elements

Identifies have been modified so they can include upper case letters, lower
case letters, underscore, and numbers as long as the numbers are not the
first character in the identifier name
the paramList can be empty. No function can lack a return value or can be a
stand alone instruction. All of them must have variable set to their value.

The viarables in <paramList> must be a super set of the paramList for the
superclass. They are then matched to the parameters of the super class based
on the name that they are given in the formal parameter list. If they do not
match it throws an error.
