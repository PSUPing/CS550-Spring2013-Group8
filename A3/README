All tasks for assignment 3 are done and packaged. Requirements to run the compiler ar python 2.7 and g++.

GENERAL: The compiler takes a mini program as input, to standard input, then produce a set of RAL instructions,
runable with the provided simulator

makefile and sample.input are attached for ease of testing. any make command needs a program as an input, so to test the compiler, one can run:
# to produce RAL instruction set to simulator/prog.txt
make compile < sample.input

# to clean every trash
make clean

# to view translated code
make view-trans < sample.input

# to view optimized code
make view-op < sample.input

# to view linked code
make link < sample.input

# to run the sample program without optimization
make run < sample.input

# to run the sample program with optimization
make run-op < sample.input

# to read code like maniac
make view
