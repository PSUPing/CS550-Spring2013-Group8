Q1/Q1.scm - These two files represent the solution to Question 4.59 of SICP.  The Q1 file is a text file containing the written answers to parts a, b, c of the question.  Q1.scm is the file that can be loaded in scheme to execute the answers described in the Q1 text file.

Q2 - This is a text file with the written answer to Question 4.65 of SICP.  

Q3.scm - This file is the scheme file for the answer to Question 4.68 of SICP.  In order to run this, copy and paste the assertions into the ";;; Query input:" prompt.  After doing so, you can run the reverse method.  An example is (reverse (1 2 3) ?x)

Q3.pl - This file is the prolog file for the answer to question 4.68 of SICP.  After loading, the method name is "my_reverse".  This was done because reverse is a reserved word in prolog.  An example is my_reverse([1,2,3],X).

Q4/Q4.scm - This is the file for the answer to question 4.75 of SICP.  The "Q4.scm" file should be loaded into scheme.  Q4 contains the text that should be copied and pasted into the ";;; Query input:" prompt. 

mini.pl - This is the answer to question 5, which asked for a prolog implementation of the mini-language.  The language should be called using the "reduce_all(config(P,BeginEnv),EndEnv)." convention.
