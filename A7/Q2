The ?who variable ends up creating a new frame with the ?person variable being replaced by the ?who variable.  And statements are evaluated in order and therefore, will start looking for anyone who has a manager.  This produces 8 results, of which Oliver is in there 3 times.  However, because the query then asks for who the person is that manages the middle manager from the first query, it comes back with 1 person managing Scrooge Eben, 3 people managing Bitdiddle Ben and 1 person managing Hacker Alyssa P.  Both Scrooge Eben and Bitdiddle Ben manage Oliver.  Since there were 4 middle manager, the ?who variable evaluates to the 4 instances of Oliver rather than the middle managers.
