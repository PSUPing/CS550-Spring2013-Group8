Assignment 5 - Scheme Interpreter

Part 2:
to run part to execute the command (load "A5boolexp") followed by the
tautology command which takes the form of (taut? '(equiv a b)) or possibly
of the form (taut? '(a (or (not a)))). It returns true if the statement is
true for all choice of variables and is false otherwise. The program first
extracts all variables by iterating through all of the elements of the list
and adding them if they are not any of the boolean functions, #t, #f, or if
the word has already been added. It stores them in a list of pairs and when
a value is added it is initialized to #f Then it tests every combination of #t and #f by treating it like a boolean number and constantly adding one until
all of the number are already one then you are done. (each variable
represents a boolean digit). Then the variables are replaced and evaluated
for their given values. If it is true it moves on, otherwise it returns
true. If it makes it to the end, then it returns true.
